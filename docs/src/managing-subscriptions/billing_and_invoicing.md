## Overview

Pricing is tier based on the amount of Links you have per Subscription and any additional invalidations.
**Subscriptions are billed and invoiced individually.** Payment arrangements like grouping multiple Subscriptions into a single 
payment and invoice is possible at volumes, please contact support if this is required. 

PayPal is used to do the monthly debit order as well as to process the one time only setup fee. The **small setup fee** is 
required to **provision the necessary infrastructure** for that subscription. 

The monthly **debit order will be processed on the first of every month**. The time elapsed between creating the Subscription
and the first billing cycle is free. As example; if you were to signup on the 10th of January, the immediate one time only setup fee
will be processed and then the monthly debit order will only be processed the first of the next month, the 1ste of February.
The time elapsed between creating the Subscription on the 10th of Jan to the 1ste of Feb will not be billed. 

::: warning IMPORTANT
PayPal might do a $1 transaction against your debit/credit card at the time of the purchase to verify that the account is still active. 
After this transaction is successful, it will be revered immediately.
